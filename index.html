  <h2 class="d-block pt-2 ps-1 bg-success">Hey there!,<br><small class="text-body-secondary">I'm Jahdiel.H.Noboh</small></h2>
<p class="lead">I'm a passionate student developer with goals of creating creative and diversive web projects. I'm currently studying in APTECH for an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering. I'm a Nigerian from birth, born in Abuja but originating from Edo. I'm driven by my love math and engineering itself which is built on problem solving and finding practical solutions.</p>

  <small class="text-body-secondary">My Skill Set</small>
</h2>
<p class="lead">Here are some languages and tools I've been mastering and working with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML: A markup language that is the foundation of all web development. I am quite good at using this language as it was the language I started with as most other developers, and I spent extensive time mastering this language.
  </li>
  <li>CSS: A styling language that gives directives to aid in the presentations of elements or tags within a webpage. I also spent an extensive time on this language as I learnt it as I was practising HTML.
  </li>
  <li>JavaScript: A programming language that is used comprehensively in front-end development, focused in improving the user interface and interactivity for websites. I have gained marginal knowledge on this language and progressing quickly to further my knowledge to move on to another programming language.  </li>
  <li>Bootstrap: A popular and important front-end framework that web developers use to build responsive web applications quicker and more efficient. I have been using this web application for sometime and I have applied its pre-written codes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to make my work quicker, efficient, and responsive to all devices.</li>
